# GSAP Motion Playground

## 🧠 Description

This project was built as part of my learning process after completing a **GSAP-focused course**.  
To put my knowledge into practice, I recreated a **replica of the GTA VI landing page**, which is known for its strong use of **GSAP-driven animations**.

The goal was to challenge myself by rebuilding complex motion patterns, scroll-based interactions, and timelines, using GSAP as the core animation tool.  
This project served as a **hands-on way to practice, experiment, and solidify my understanding of GSAP** in a real-world-inspired scenario.
